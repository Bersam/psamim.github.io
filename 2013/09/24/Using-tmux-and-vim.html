			<p>Using terminal is essential in Vim for me. There are some shells for vim but they are slow, blocking or lack features. With tmux you have your own real shell beside you. The first thing I wanted to do was to be able to quickly open a new pane, this tmux script does that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh">splitw -v -p 20           <span class="c"># Split pane 1 horizontally by 20%</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I saved this in a file calld <code>vimo</code> and set a key mapping for that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nb">bind </span>t <span class="nb">source</span>-file ~/.tmux/vimo
<span class="nb">bind </span>q <span class="nb">kill</span>-pane -a <span class="c"># Close all other panes but this</span>
</code></pre></div>
